# player_valuation_data_analysis
Conducted EDA on player_valuation data 

 1) Football is one of the few things I am passionate about, hence playing around with football data seemed like 
    a fun activity!

 2) Like diwali_sales_analysis_P1 I have continued analysing the data using the 'groupby' method as its best for 
    making inference on relationship  between two columns in a datset. 

 3) Experimented  SeaBorn feature 'distplot' for plotting the histogram and setting 'kde' to true
    for Kernel Density Estimation to get an idea of the normality of the sample.

 4) Experimented with pandas' 'groupby' method with multiple groups as columns for detailed analysis
